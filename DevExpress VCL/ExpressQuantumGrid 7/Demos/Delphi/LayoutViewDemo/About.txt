This demo shows a Layout View that provides advanced customization of the layout of a record card at runtime.

In the demo, you can perform the following operations:

# Customize the card's layout.
  Click the "Customize Layout" button to open the Customization Form. This also activates customization mode.
  In the Customization Form, re-structure the card layout both manually (via drag and drop) and by using the context menus.

# Arrange the cards within the View in different ways:
  - Display a single card in the View.
  - Display cards in rows (across the View).
  - Display cards in columns.
  - Display only cards that are entirely visible in the View (in other words, clipped cards are not shown in the View).
  - Center a card or cards (rows or columns) in the View.
  - Display expand buttons in cards to make the cards collapsible.

Known Issues in Beta 1:

1. After posting data to the data store, the following states are currently not retained:
  a. The card and layout group collapse state (if the expand button is available).
  b. The active tab in tabbed layout groups.

2. Keyboard navigation is disabled for the following scenarios:
  a. Layout group collapse and expand.
  b. Tab navigation in tabbed layout groups.

3. The Layout View's StoreTo~ and RestoreFrom~ methods are not yet implemented.

These features will be available in successive betas, or in the final release.

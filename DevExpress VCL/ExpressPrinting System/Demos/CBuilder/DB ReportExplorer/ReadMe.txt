   If you do not own appropriate Control Libraries from Developer Express Inc., part of Reports 
cannot be used, because last ones are needed specific ReportItems for rendering from these Libraries.
   Mentioned above ReportItems are the part of ReportLinks for these Libraries.

   In case you own them, just uncomment directives placed top of Main.cpp and Main.h according
to the following explanation:
     - dxPScxSSLnk for ExpressSpreadSheet
     - dxPSdxLCLnk for ExpressLayoutControl (Only available in Delphi5 and higher)
     - dxPScxCommon for ExpressEditors
       (also needed for ExpressQuntumGrid v4, ExpressQuntumTree v4 and ExpressVerticalGrid v3)
     - dxPSExtCommon for ExpressExtendedEditors

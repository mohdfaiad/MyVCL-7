Version 1.7

   + Added Delphi 6 support.

   In TDBLookupComboboxEh
     + Added AlwaysShowBorder propery.

   * Some bugfixes.

Version 1.61

    In TDBLookupComboboxEh
     + Added OnNotInList event. Event occurs when the user enters a value 
         that isn't in the lookup list.

    In TDBSumListProducer

    In TDBGridEh
     + Added possibility to set aggregate fields in footers at design time.
       So you can use more powerful mechanism of aggregate values imbedded 
       in TClientDataSet component.

   * Some bugfixes.

Version 1.6

    + Added new component TDBLookupComboboxEh:
      Provides all functionality of TDBLookupCombobox and adds 
      several new features as follows:
        Can have flat style.  
        Allows assign values as to KeyValue property just and to 
          display Text property.
        Allows to type (assign) values to Text property not 
          contained in data list (Style = csDropDownEh).
        Allows to hold KeyValue and Text as not affecting to 
          each other values. Take effect when KeyField, ListField, 
          ListSource, DataField and DataSource properties is empty.
        Drop down list can:
          Show titles,
          Have sizing grip,
          Automaticaly set width as sum of DisplayWidth of 
            the list fields (Width = -1),
          Automaticaly drops on user pressed the key.
        Edit button can:
          Show DropDown, Ellipsis or Bitmap image.
          Have specified width.
        Have additional events: OnKeyValueChanged, OnButtonClick.

   In TDBGridEh
    + In Flat mode shows edit buttons just as flat.

   In TColumnEh
    + Added DropDownShowTitles property. 
    
   * Some bugfixes.


Version 1.58

   In TDBGridEh
    + Added dghIncSearch and dghPreferIncSearch values in TDBGridEhOption 
       type (property OptionsEh).
         dghIncSearch value allows to do increment search in grid.
         dghPreferIncSearch value determine that the grid prefer increment 
         search to cell editing.
        At run time you can use next key for increment searching:
          Ctrl+F - to begin increment searching.
          Ctrl+Enter - to search next matching.
          Ctrl+Shift+Enter - to search prior matching.
        If dghIncSearch in OptionsEh and column is read only then grid
        will set increment search mode automatically on first key press 
        and will set normal mode after 1.5 sec.
 
   In TColumnEh
    + Added Tag property. Tag has no predefined meaning. The Tag property 
        is provided for the convenience of developers.
    + Added DropDownSizing property. Set DropDownSizing to True to allow 
        users to resize dropdown lookup or picklist window.

   * Some bugfixes.

Version 1.57

   TPassthroughColumn class has been unloaded. In csDefault and csCustomized 
    state uses the same class TColumnEh. It allows to inherit TDBGridEh class
    and add new properties in TColumnEh class.  

   In TColumnEh
    + Allows to show tooltips text for KeyImage based columns. 
        When you adjust column properies to show bitmaps depending on field 
        values you can fill also PickList propery by values of tooltip text.
        Set also Tooltips property to True and ShowHint property of DGBGridEh 
        to True. At runtime by moving mouse above image will forces to show 
        text from PickList in tooltips window.

   In TColumnTitleEh 
    + Added property Orientation: TTextOrientationEh;
        TTextOrientationEh = (tohHorizontal, tohVertical);
        Allows to draw text vertically. Only single line text support for
        vertical orientation.  

   * Some bugfixes.

Version 1.56

  Added new unit "DBGridEhImpExp.pas" that containt objects and routines:
    1. To export DBGridEh at next formats: Text, Csv, HTML, RTF, XLS and

     procedure SaveDBGridEhToExportFile( ExportClass: TDBGridEhExportClass;
       DBGridEh: TCustomDBGridEh; const FileName: String; IsSaveAll: Boolean);
     procedure WriteDBGridEhToExportStream( ExportClass: TDBGridEhExportClass;
       DBGridEh: TCustomDBGridEh; Stream: TStream; IsSaveAll: Boolean);

     Where the ExportClass parameter is one of the next classes:
        TDBGridEhExportAsText, TDBGridEhExportAsCsv, TDBGridEhExportAsHTML,
        TDBGridEhExportAsRTF, TDBGridEhExportAsVCLDBIF or TDBGridEhExportAsXLS.
            IsSaveAll parameter indicates whether to export whole grid or
        only selection.

    2. To import DBGridEh from Text and internal format (VCLDBIF).
      procedure LoadDBGridEhFromImportFile( ImportClass: TDBGridEhImportClass;
        DBGridEh: TCustomDBGridEh; const FileName: String; IsLoadToAll: Boolean);
      procedure ReadDBGridEhFromImportStream(ImportClass: TDBGridEhImportClass;
        DBGridEh: TCustomDBGridEh; Stream: TStream; IsLoadToAll: Boolean);

     Where the ImportClass parameter is one of the next classes:
        TDBGridEhImportAsText, TDBGridEhImportAsVCLDBIF.


    3. To Copy, Paste, Cut DBGridEh to/from clipboard.
      procedure DBGridEh_DoCutAction(DBGridEh: TCustomDBGridEh; ForWholeGrid:Boolean);
      procedure DBGridEh_DoCopyAction(DBGridEh: TCustomDBGridEh; ForWholeGrid:Boolean);
      procedure DBGridEh_DoPasteAction(DBGridEh: TCustomDBGridEh; ForWholeGrid:Boolean);
      procedure DBGridEh_DoDeleteAction(DBGridEh: TCustomDBGridEh; ForWholeGrid:Boolean);

  In TDBGridEh
    + Added property EditActions: TDBGridEhEditActions.
        TDBGridEhEditAction = (geaCutEh, geaCopyEh, geaPasteEh, geaDeleteEh,
                               geaSelectAllEh);
        TDBGridEhEditActions = set of TDBGridEhEditAction;
        Specifies actions (inherited from TEditAction) that grid can update and
          execute.
    + Added some functions to support edit actions.

  * Although this version of EhLib can export to XLS (Biff) format, MS Excel can not 
     accept this data from clipboard. Probably I don't completely correct write to 
     this format. Please let me know if you have detail information about Biff format.
